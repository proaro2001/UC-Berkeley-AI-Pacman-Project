## Intro
[The Pacman Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) by the [University of California, Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu/).

This project focuses on exploring foundational AI concepts by implementing search algorithms for Pacman, the iconic video game character. The goal is to develop an intelligent Pacman Agent that can efficiently navigate mazes, collect food, and reach specific destinations.

## Getting Started
To get started with the UCBerkeley AI-Pacman-Project, follow the steps below:
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) and other necessary dependencies and libraries
3. Play a Pacman game by tpying in the terminal:```$ python pacman.py```
4. Check out all options and their default settings via:```$ python pacman.py -h```
5. Have fun!

## Project 1: Search

### Algorithm Expored and Lessons Learned

In this project, I had the opportunity to implement and explore several search algorithms

- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Uniform cost search
- A* search algorithms
- Heuristic- based approaches

These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world

More information about the implementation details, please visit [Project 1 Search](https://github.com/proaro2001/UC-Berkeley-AI-Pacman-Project/tree/main/search)


## Project 2: MultiAgent

In this project, I have explored the following search algorithms:

- Reflex Agent
- Minimax
- Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Expectimax
- Evaluation Function

These algorithms are used to design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts.

## Project 3: Reinforcement Learning

In this project, I have explored the following search algorithms:

- Markov Decision Processing
- Value iteration
- Manipulating discount, noise, and living rewards 
- Asynchronous Value Iteration
- Prioritized Sweeping Value Iteration
- Q-Learning
- Epilson Greedy
- Approximate Q-Learning

Concepts related to topic of reinforcement learning.
